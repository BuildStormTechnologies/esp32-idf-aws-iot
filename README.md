# ESP32 IDF AWS IoT Platform
The Buildstorm platform simplifies the integration of AWS IoT core features onto ESP32 Hardware, from basic IoT functionalities to advanced features like OTA updates and provisioning.

The architecture is based on the core IDF APIs, complemented by a C++ wrapper tailored for application use, guaranteeing the non-blocking operation of all APIs. Each user action, including HTTP requests, MQTT publishing, Shadow updates, and OTA, is logged as an event and seamlessly managed in the background. To maintain this seamless operation, the platform effectively runs a system task.

This establishes a robust foundation for your upcoming IoT project.

Supported features:

1. MQTT pub/sub
2. Shadow updates
3. Jobs
4. Web OTA using AWS jobs and S3 bucket
5. Local webserver OTA
6. Provision by claim
7. BLE Device Provisioning

## Requirements
1. This library uses esp-idf v5.2.0

---

## Example Setup
1. Follow [this article](https://buildstorm.com/blog/aws_iot_provision_by_claim/) to setup AWS and generate provisioning certificates.
2. The same certificates will be used for all examples
3. Copy the generated claim certificates to `examples\_Certificates\claimCerts` folder and rename them as follows
   1. `aws-root-ca.pem`
   2. `claim-certificate.pem`
   3. `claim-private.pem.key`
3. Copy the generated thing certificates to `examples\_Certificates\thingCerts` folder and rename them as follows
   1. `aws-root-ca.pem`
   2. `thing-certificate.pem`
   3. `thing-private.pem.key`
4. Use the respective sdkconfig files for esp32, esp32s3. The partition settings are already taken care of in the sdkconfigs.
5. Update the following WiFi and AWS parameters in `app_config.h` of the example
```
#define TEST_WIFI_SSID     "YOUR WIFI SSID"
#define TEST_WIFI_PASSWORD "YOUR WIFI PWD"

#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST "YOUR AWS HOST"
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT  8883
#define AWS_PROVISION_TEMPLATE_NAME "YOUR PROVISION TEMPLATE"

```
